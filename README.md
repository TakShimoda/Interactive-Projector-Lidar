# Interactive-Projector-Lidar
Interactive Projection Lidar Screen

This repository contains code to read from the LS02C Lidar and create an interactive projection screen.
Two main codes are the Lidar processing code and code to generate the GUI.

Working_code.py works to read live data from Lidar and control the mouse.

MyGUI.py contains the module for the GUI.
